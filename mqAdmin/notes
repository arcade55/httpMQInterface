14 Sep 2022 12:04 looking at using volumes and scripts to create mq server and mq client certicates

using:

docker run -i --entrypoint=/bin/bash --volume hostgettermdepositdetails_devcontainer_qmdata:/mnt/mqm ibmcom/mq:latest < selfCertCreation.sh 



contents of ascript.sh
cd /mnt/mqm
mkdir -p MQServer/certs
cd MQServer/certs
touch testtest


with this approach, a favourable result would be to run a script to build the necessary tls dbs with the extracted
and imported certs and have this on the results on a volume which the running instances of the mq server and the mq client could then
reference.

This would enable repeatable builds etc. etc.
